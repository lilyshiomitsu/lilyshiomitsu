💼 **About Me**  
I am a highly motivated computer science student with experience in AI/ML, web development, and software engineering. My journey includes a software engineering internship at **Ultimate Kronos Group (UKG)** and participation in the **Break Through Tech AI Fellowship @ MIT**, where I worked on building a travel itinerary generator using LLM models. I will also be a DevOps software engineer co-op @ **Wolters Kluwer** this upcoming spring semester.  
I enjoy leveraging **object-oriented programming**, working with **large datasets,** and optimizing **real-time applications.** When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, playing the cello, and exploring different languages on Duolingo, where I hold a 264-day streak!
